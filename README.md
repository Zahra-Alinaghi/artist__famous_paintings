"# artist__famous_paintings" 

In this project, we aim to explore the extent to which neural networks can possess artistic understanding. ðŸŽ¨ We will also investigate the implementation of transfer learning and image data augmentation and their impact on model performance. The dataset we have consists of several hundred paintings by several renowned artists worldwide, and our goal is to train a deep learning model that can, like an art expert, correctly guess the artist of a painting whose creator is yet unknown.

Please note that the dataset is approximately 580 MB in size.
